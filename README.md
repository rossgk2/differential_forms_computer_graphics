# Tensors, differential forms, and computer graphics
A textbook on the application of differential forms to computer graphics. This book is 100% complete as of Nov. 9 2020.

## Outline of the textbook

* Logic and proofs
* Review of linear algebra
* Multilinear algebra and tensors: tensor product spaces, dual spaces, (p, q) tensors, bilinear forms and metric tensors
* Exterior powers
* Review of multivariable calculus
* Introduction to topology
* Smooth manifolds, differential forms, and Stoke's theorem on smooth manifolds with corners
* Computer graphics

## Logic and proofs

As of Jan. 25 2021, an in-progress chapter on logic and proofs is now included in the book. Just because this section is incomplete does not mean that no one will find it helpful; there is a potentially very helpful section on the implication operator that might interest proof-writers of any level. The chapter is complete up until the "Set difference and set complement" section. (A historical note: the content of this chapter that is complete was written in 2020, long before Jan. 25 2021; it is on Jan. 25 2021 that I decided to include this material in the compiled PDF).
