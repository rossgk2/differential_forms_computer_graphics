Part II: Calculus and basic topology
6. Review of calculus
7. Basic topology

Part III: Differential forms
8. Manifolds
9. Differential forms on manifolds

Part IV: Computational applications of differential forms
10. Discrete differential geometry and computer graphics
10.1. Discrete differential geometry
10.2. Smoothing with the Laplacian
10.3. Surface parameterization

## Logic and proofs

As of Jan. 25 2021, an in-progress chapter on logic and proofs is now included in the book. Just because this section is incomplete does not mean that no one will find it helpful; there is a potentially very helpful section on the implication operator that might interest proof-writers of any level. The chapter is complete up until the "Set difference and set complement" section. (A historical note: the content of this chapter that is complete was written in 2020, long before Jan. 25 2021; it is on Jan. 25 2021 that I decided to include this material in the compiled PDF).
